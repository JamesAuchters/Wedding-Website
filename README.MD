I learn new things and my fiance is heaps happy. Win Win?

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/JamesAuchterlonie/Wedding%20Website/_apis/build/status/JamesAuchters.WeddingWebsite?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/JamesAuchterlonie/Wedding%20Website/_build/latest?definitionId=7&branchName=master)


##Lazy man's documentation/notes
For local testing and implementation, you must set TWO environment variables. I included the building of a storage account and table in the pipeline, however had already input the required data to an existing setup & didn't really progress beyond this.
These must correspond to an Azure Storage Account, containing two tables with the name: weddingtable & weddingrsvptable
The table should contain the following columns: Names, Names2, Hide, Message

Easy peasy docker building here:
docker image build -t weddingwebsite:0.1 .
docker container run --publish target:source --detach --name Shortnick --env StorageName='storageaccountnamehere' --env StorageKey='super secret SAS Key here==' weddingwebsite:0.1
docker container rm --force Shortnick

##Credits
I took stock images for demonstration purposes from the following locations - These replaced personal images for obvious reasons.
